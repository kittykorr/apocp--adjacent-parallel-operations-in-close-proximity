ADJACENT PARALLEL OPERATIONS IN CLOSE PROXIMITY

BY FOLLOWING THE STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE APOCP, 
MULTIPLE OPERATIONS CAN BE MAINTAINED SEPERATELY AND CONFIDENTIALLY BY SEPERATE OPERATING GROUPS EVEN IN CLOSE PROXIMITY
ON THE SAME NETWORKS, SERVERS, OR WITHIN ORGANIZATIONS AND SOCIAL GROUPS.

TO RUN APOCP EFFECTIVELY, ENSURE THAT RUNWAY CENTERLINES ARE SPACED APPROPRIATELY, TYPICALLY REQUIRING SPECIAL PROCEDURES
TO MAINTAIN SEPERATION BETWEEN AIRCRAFT.

USE INDEPENDENT OR DEPENDENT APPROACH METHODS, AND ENSURE STRICT COMPLIANCE WITH AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL INSTRUCTIONS
FOR SAFE OPERATIONS.


FOR THOSE READING ALONG, WE ARE USING AN AIRPORT AS A METAPHOR. 

WHAT WE ARE ACTUALLY TALKING ABOUT, IS INTERNET TRAFFIC THROUGH A WIRELESS ACCESS POINT, OR WET A** P*SSY.

BELOW, ARE A FEW STANDARDS THAT INDIVIDUAL OPERATORS CAN FOLLOW TO ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN SOVEREIGN IDENTITY,
KEEPING THEIR AIR TRAFFIC SEPERATE AND UNIQUELY IDENTIFIABLE IN CONTRAST TO THE PARALLEL OPERATIONS BEING MAINTAINED AT THE SAME AIRPORT.


1. ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN SOVEREIGN IDENTITY.
	-USE STATIC IP AND MAC ADDRESSES ON DEVICES.
		THIS ENSURES ALL TRAFFIC COMING FROM AND TO YOUR DEVICES ARE IDENTIFIABLE AND TRACEABLE TO YOUR DEVICE AND ONLY YOUR DEVICE.
		THIS AVOIDS CONFUSION AND ENSURES DATA INTENDED FOR YOU REACHES YOU AND ONLY YOU.

	-USE A VPN
		THIS CAN MASK YOUR DEVICES IDENTITY ON A LOCAL NETWORK, AND TO OUTSIDE EYES THAT MAY BE TRYING TO PRY INTO YOUR DATA.
		THE USE OF A VPN IS IMPORTANT, AS IT ENCRYPTS ALL DATA BEFORE IT LEAVES YOUR DEVICE, ADDING A LAYER OF SECURITY TO YOUR 
		DATA TRASMISSIONS.
		USE ONLY TRUSTED AND VERIFIED VPN PROVIDERS, OR CONFIGURE YOUR OWN SERVER TO ROUTE TRAFFIC THROUGH.

	-CONFIGURE CUSTOM DNS SETTINGS
		WHEN USED PROPERLY, THIS ENSURES THAT YOUR DATA IS ROUTED THROUGH SECURE AND SEPERATE NETWORKS FROM OTHERS THAT
		MAY BE USING THE SAME LOCAL NETWORK AS YOU.
		BE SURE TO COORDINATE WITH ADJACENT OPERATORS TO ENSURE YOU ARE NOT ROUTING TRAFFIC THROUGH THE SAME SERVERS, IF YOU
		INTEND TO KEEP YOUR TRAFFIC SEPERATE.

	-USE TOR NETWORK
		THIS CAN ENSURE THAT YOUR TRAFFIC IS TUNNELED THROUGH A SECURE SYSTEM OF NETWORKS AND SERVERS, ADDING A LEVEL OF
		SECURITY AND ANONYMITY TO YOUR TRAFFIC AFTER IT LEAVES YOUR NETWORK. 
		THIS CAN ENSURE THAT YOUR DATA IS HARDER TO IDENTIFY BY ADVERSARIAL OPERATORS.

	-SUBNET YOUR LOCAL NETWORK
		THINK OF SUBNETTING LIKE THE DIFFERENT HOUSING DISCTRICTS OF A NEIGHBORHOOD.
		YOUR LOCAL NETWORK CAN BE CONFIGURED TO ALOT A CERTAIN RANGE OF IP ADDRESSES TO SPECIFIED DEVICES, THIS ALLOWS
		THE NETWORK ADMINISTRATOR AND COMMUNICATING SERVERS TO IDENTIFY TRAFFIC MORE EASILY.

	-USE A FIREWALL AND STRICT RULES TO BLOCK UNWANTED TRAFFIC FROM YOUR DEVICES
		THIS ENSURES UNWANTED TRAFFIC AND DATA ARE NOT PERMITTED TO ENTER OR LEAVE YOUR DEVICE.
		YOU CAN BLOCK ALL THOSE UNNECESSARY ADS, AND DOMAINS THAT YOU DON'T LIKE SEEING ON YOUR DEVICES.
		WHEN I FIREWALL IS CONFIGURED PROPERLY, YOUR DEVICE WILL REFUSE TO CONNECT TO THE DOMAINS RESPONSIBLE.

	-ALWAYS REMEMBER TO MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS
		IF YOU SUSPECT YOU ARE NOT THE INTENDED RECEIVER OF ANY COMMUNICATIONS OR DATA, COORDINATE WITH ADJACENT OPERATORS
		BE OPEN AND HONEST ABOUT WHAT YOU AR OBSERVING. 
		THIS ALLOWS BOTH YOU AND ADJACENT OPERATORS TO BETTER MANAGE AND CURATE YOUR DATA FEEDS FOR ACCURATE INTELLIGENCE

2. RESPECT THE CONFIDENTIALITY, INTEGRITY, AND ACCESSIBILITY OF ADJACENT OPERATIONS IN YOUR PROXIMITY.
	-THE CIA TRIAD IS FUNDEMENTAL TO INFORMATION SECURITY. 
		THESE PRINCIPLES ARE COMMONLY USED IN BUSINESS TO DETER AND PREVENT
		UNNECESSARY LOSSES TO INFORMATION AND FINANCES.
		HOWEVER, UTILIZATION OF THE CIA TRIAD CAN BE USED TO GUIDE ALL ORGANIZATIONS 
		AND OPERATIONS IN PROTECTING SENSITIVE DATA.

	-WHEN FOLLOWED CORRECTLY, THESE PRINCIPLES ENSURE THE FOLLOWING:
		1. CONFIDENTIALITY:
			-THE PRACTICE OF KEEPING SENSITIVE INFORMATION PRIVATE AND SECURE,
			ENSURING IT IS NOT DISCLOSED TO UNAUTHORIZED INDIVIDUALS.

		2. INTEGRITY:
			-REGARDING INFORMATION SECURITY, THE ASSURANCE THAT DATA IS ACCURATE,
			COMPLETE, AND UNALTERED - THIS IS CRUCIAL TO MAINTAINING TRUSTWORTHINESS
			AND RELIABILITY, ENSURING CONSISTENCY AND VALIDITY.

		3. ACCESSIBILITY (AVALABILITY)
			-REFERS TO THE PRINCIPLE OF AVAILABILITY,
			ENSURING THAT DATA AND SYSTEMS ARE ACCESSIBLE TO 
			- AUTHORIZED - USERS PERMITTED TO ACCESS CERTAIN DATA.
			THIS IS CRUCIAL FOR MAINTAINING ADJACENT PARALLEL OPERATIONS IN CLOSE PROXIMITY.


BASICALLY, IF IT AINT YOUR OPERATION, IT AINT YOUR BUSINESS. MIND YOUR BUSINESS.
KEEP YOUR EYES ON YOUR OWN HOMEWORK.

WHEN RUNNING APOCP, IF AN ADJACENT OPERATOR TELLS YOU TO MIND YOUR BUSINESS AND RESPECT THEIR SOVEREIGNTY, LISTEN.

THERE ARE TIMES WHEN ADJACENT OPERATIONS DO OVERLAP AND NEED TO WORK TOGETHER IN A COORDINATED FASHION, HOWEVER THAT IS LESS COMMON
THAN A LOT OF OPERATORS PRESUME.

THE CIA TRIAD WAS ADOPTED AND ADAPTED TO FIT APOCP TO PROTECT ALL OPERATIONS 
AND ENSURE ADJACENT OPERATIONS CAN REMAIN PARALLEL, EVEN IN CLOSE PROXIMITY.

THE PRICIPLES WITHIN THE CIA TRIAD EXIST TO PROTECT EACH OPERATOR AND THEIR OPERATIONS.

UNLESS EXPLICITLY GIVEN AUTHORIZATION BY THE OPERATOR RUNNING THE SPECIFIC OPERATION, JUST MIND YOUR BUSINESS.

NOSY OPERATOR ARE A LIABILITY TO CLANDESTINE AND COVERT OPERATIONS.

IF YOU CANNOT KEEP YOUR EYES ON YOUR OWN HOMEWORK, YOU CANNOT PASS THE TEST AND WILL NOT BE PERMITTED INVOLVEMENT IN FUTURE OPERATIONS.
