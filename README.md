# apocp--adjacent-parallel-operations-in-close-proximity
This is somewhat of an SOP or guideline, meant to be interpreted by individual function and adapted to a plethora of operational situations.

INTENDED USE: to be applied and interpretted to operations existing on the same networks, but not necessarily correlating or wanting to be associated.
    The principles provided can help ensure smooth operations and hold each operator or user accoountable to their operations.

    Oftentimes, when sharing networks with multiple operators, our operations can become lost in a complex web of transmissions.
        This can be beneficial when trying to disguise your operations, which is oftentimes a priority, especially when intending to communicate securely.

        However, there are other times when operations need to be accountable for their traffic and more easily identifiable from the traffic around them.

        This can actually provide a layer of security, at the cost of anonymity.

        Since nothing on the internet is private anyway, may as well try to seperate our operations the best we can when forced to run in close proximity.

        Please feel free to add comments with suggestions or corrections.
